        <h4>About:</h4>
        <p class="b_bg">I was born and raised in Omaha Nebraska. I was in the navy for four years as a <mark>avionics tech</mark>. After that I got training through Rockwell Automation to be a <mark>automation and controls engineer</mark>. After two years of working for Groupo Bimbo automating their bread lines I quit to learn software development. I've done some work with python, MySQL, CSS, HTML.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="b_bg">In the future I hope to start my own buisness in software development. I want to specialize in making full stack web apps for contracting companies like electricians, plummers, and painters. Because I alredy have a backround in those kinds of career fields I feel I can meet the needs for them a lot easier.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Things I hope to get out of this program:</h4>
        <ul class="bio-list">
            <li>Learn Javascript</li>
            <li>learn React</li>
            <li>Class based views in Django</li>
            <li>Better understand Bootstrap</li>
